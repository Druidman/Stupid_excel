# Stupid_excel
I got very damn frustrated with excel inabillity to search for table html tag inside website....

# How to Use

## Run

Just run `main.py` file and server will host on localhost(`http://127.0.0.1:5000`) and on ip that you can acces thru other computer/phone connected to the same router.

## Use

Type the second ip not `http://127.0.0.1:5000` into excel data importing option and it should find table without any problems. Then just hit import and you are good to go.
